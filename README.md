# User Form Component

A simple web component that allows users to add their information (name, email, and age) via a form. The form is validated before submission, and users' data is stored in the browser's localStorage. This component includes error handling, form validation, and a visually styled form with a box-shadow and centered layout.

## Features

- **Form Validation**: Ensures all required fields (name, email, and age) are correctly filled before submission.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages next to invalid input fields.
- **User List**: Displays a list of users added through the form.
- **LocalStorage**: Saves user data to the browser's localStorage for persistence across page reloads.
- **Styled Form**: The form is centered on the screen with a box-shadow for a clean, modern look.
